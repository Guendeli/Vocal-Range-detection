as a first step before building audio/voice controlled apps, we'll need to first establish our vocal range of possible notes they can sing/play.

This repository establishes that vocal range, using Pygame in the window size.

## Running the App

```bash
$ python3 establish-range.py -input
```
input argument is the audio recording device.
